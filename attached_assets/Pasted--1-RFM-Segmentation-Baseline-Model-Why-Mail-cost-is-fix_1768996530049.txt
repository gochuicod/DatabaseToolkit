### **1. RFM Segmentation (Baseline Model)**

- **Why:** Mail cost is fixed, so target only the top segments (Champions, Loyal, At Risk).
- **How:** Score each BOID with Recency, Frequency, Monetary.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - **High RFM** → Always mail (they respond).
    - **Medium RFM** → Selectively mail (e.g., only during campaigns with high historical ROI).
    - **Low RFM** → Suppress (save cost).

### **2. Campaign Response Model (Per Market/Product)**

- **Why:** Some campaigns or products simply perform better in some markets.
- **How:** Join Campaign_mailed + Purchase_History to measure conversion per Market x Campaign x Product.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Only run campaigns in markets with proven **conversion lift**.
    - Drop markets with **consistent low response**.

### **3. Propensity-to-Respond Model**

- **Why:** Mailing costs money → score each customer with probability of purchase if mailed.
- **How:** Logistic regression / tree models using demographics, RFM, campaign history.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Sort customers by score.
    - Set a cutoff based on budget (e.g., only mail top 40% most likely to respond).

### **4. Reactivation Model**

- **Why:** You don’t want to waste on long-term inactive customers *unless* they were historically valuable.
- **How:** Identify customers with high LTV but no purchase in 12+ months.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Send **“Win-back” campaigns** only to dormant but high-value customers.
    - Suppress “low-value inactive” → save cost.

### **5. Prospect Lookalike Model**

- **Why:** You have prospects (in Campaign_mailed) who never bought. Some may still be good bets.
- **How:** Build a “lookalike” model → compare profiles of actual buyers vs non-buyers.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Only mail prospects that **look similar** to your top buyers.
    - Avoid blind mailing to all prospects.

### **6. Product Affinity / Upsell Model**

- **Why:** If someone bought Product A, they’re more likely to buy Product B (e.g., basket analysis).
- **How:** Use Purchase_History to map product associations.
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Mail **cross-sell campaigns** only to customers with matching purchase history.

### **7. ROI Optimization Model**

- **Why:** Each mailer has a cost → not all campaigns generate enough revenue to justify mailing everyone.
- **How:** Calculate ROI per campaign (Revenue from mailers ÷ Cost of mailers).
- **Mailing List Use:**
    - Focus on campaigns where ROI > 1.5x or 2x.
    - Reduce mailers on low-ROI campaigns.
